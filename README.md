Disable clipboard manipulations
===============================

This extension has been discontinued, its source is only being kept for reference purposes. The ability to prevent websites from intercepting copy and paste events is a built-in feature of current Firefox versions, you can go to `about:config` and set the `dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled` preference to `false` to achieve that effect.
